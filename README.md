# Banking-System

Basically here in this project, I have planned to create a banking system where users can create their accounts and make deposits in it as well as withdraw amounts from thier account if they have sufficient balance in it. Here I have set the minimum balance as 500. So upon creating an account and while withdrawing 500 has to be the minimum amount that has to be present in it. 

I have created an account class which basically holds all the infiormations reagrding an account such as the Account holders Name, Balance and their account number.
It also holds functions of Deposit and withdraw. I also planend to write these informations in a txt file and be able to read from that file too. Moreover, I have overloaded the << operator so that I can print objects using this operator. 

I have also created a Bank class to hold all the informations of the accounts and in this class I have included the functions to equiry about balance and develpoed the deposit, withdraw, closeAccount and ShowAllAccounts using Map data structure and used iterator to search them. 

In the main class I have enabled user to select from 7 options that are available. I have used switch case to execute this and do while loop continues untill the user selects the exit option.
